# Introducing Person/Object Detection to Your Application

Welcome to the documentation for our detection system! This system combines the power of machine learning with the convenience of modern technologies to provide real-time monitoring and analysis of camera feeds.

With our system, you can easily set up a camera feed and receive real-time object and person detection notifications. Our object detection and person detection models are based on YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm that offers high accuracy and real-time performance.

In this documentation, you will find all the information you need to set up and use our system in your organization. From installation and configuration to API usage and advanced analytics, we've got you covered. So let's get started and see what our system can do for you!
