# Introducing Person/Object Detection to Your Application

Welcome to the documentation for our detection system! This system combines the power of machine learning with the convenience of modern technologies to provide real-time monitoring and analysis of camera feeds.

With our system, you can easily set up a camera feed and receive real-time object and person detection notifications. Our object detection and person detection models are based on YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm that offers high accuracy and real-time performance.
